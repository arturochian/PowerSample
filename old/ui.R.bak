study for wich the control group\'s survival distribution is Weibull with 1-year
survival of .95 and 3-year survival of .7. All subjects are followed at least
one year, and patients enter the study with linearly increasing probability
starting with zero. Assume (1) there is no chance of dropin for the first 6
months, then the probability increases linearly up to .15 at 5 years; (2) there
is a linearly increasing chance of dropout up to .3 at 5 years; and (3) the
treatment has no effect for the first 9 months, then it has a constant effect
(hazard ratio of .75).'
